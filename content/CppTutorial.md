Modern C++ has introduced a plethora of features that have revolutionized the way developers manage resources and state in their applications. In this blog, we'll explore the basics of smart pointers, RAII, and other modern C++ features that help you write cleaner and more efficient code.

## What is RAII?

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom used in C++ to manage resource allocation and deallocation. It ties the lifecycle of a resource to the lifetime of an object, ensuring that resources are properly released when they are no longer needed.

## Why Use RAII and Smart Pointers?

RAII and smart pointers solve a wide variety of problems related to resource management in C++. They help prevent memory leaks, ensure exception safety, and make it easier to manage complex resource lifecycles.

## Commonly Used Smart Pointers

### std::unique_ptr

The `std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns a dynamically allocated object exclusively. It ensures that the object is deleted when the `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope.

```cpp showLineNumbers {4}
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
void uniquePtrExample() {
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl;
} // ptr is automatically deleted here
```

### std::shared_ptr

The `std::shared_ptr` is a smart pointer that maintains shared ownership of a dynamically allocated object. Multiple `std::shared_ptr` instances can own the same object, and the object is deleted when the last `std::shared_ptr` owning it is destroyed.

```cpp showLineNumbers{number}
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void sharedPtrExample() {
    std::shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    {
        std::shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = ptr1;
        std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr2 << std::endl;
    } // ptr2 goes out of scope here, but the object is not deleted
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr1 << std::endl;
} // ptr1 is automatically deleted here
```

### std::weak_ptr

The `std::weak_ptr` is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning reference to an object managed by `std::shared_ptr`. It is used to break circular references that can occur with `std::shared_ptr`.

```cpp showLineNumbers{number}
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void weakPtrExample() {
    std::shared_ptr<int> sharedPtr = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    std::weak_ptr<int> weakPtr = sharedPtr;

    if (auto lockedPtr = weakPtr.lock()) {
        std::cout << "Value: " << *lockedPtr << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The object has been deleted." << std::endl;
    }
} // sharedPtr is automatically deleted here
```

## Conclusion

Modern C++ provides powerful tools for resource management through RAII and smart pointers. By leveraging these features, you can write safer, more efficient, and more maintainable code. Understanding and using `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` effectively will help you manage resources in your C++ projects with ease.
