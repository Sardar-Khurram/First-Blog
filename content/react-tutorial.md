React Hooks have revolutionized the way developers build components in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. In this blog, we'll explore the basics of Hooks, their benefits, and how you can use them to write cleaner and more efficient code.

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know, such as state, lifecycle, context, refs, and more.

## Why Use Hooks?

Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we've encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. They make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components, break down complex components into smaller functions, and manage side effects more effectively.

## Commonly Used Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook is the most basic and commonly used hook. It allows you to add state to your functional components. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useContext

The `useContext` hook lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
}
```

### useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>
        +
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>
        -
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useRef

The `useRef` hook allows you to persist values between renders and directly access DOM elements. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to reuse stateful logic between components. A custom hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and that may call other hooks. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }

    // Assume we have a ChatAPI that subscribes to a friend's status
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  }, [friendID]);

  return isOnline;
}
```

In conclusion, React Hooks provide a powerful and expressive way to manage state and side effects in your functional components. By understanding and utilizing these hooks, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient React code.
